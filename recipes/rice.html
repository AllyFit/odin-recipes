        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>rice, (Oryza sativa), edible starchy cereal grain and the grass plant (family Poaceae) by which it is produced. </p>
        <p>Roughly one-half of the world population, including virtually all of East and Southeast Asia, is wholly dependent upon rice as a staple food; 95 percent of the world's rice crop is eaten by humans. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup long-grain white rice</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, optional</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley, optional</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>Gather the ingredients.</p>
            <li>Step 2</li>
            <p>Rinse the rice until the water runs clear. Drain in a colander and set aside.</p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>In a medium saucepan, bring the 2 cups of water to a boil. Add the salt, stir, and then add the rinsed and drained rice. Stir with a fork.</p>
            <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>Reduce the heat, cover the rice, and let it simmer for 20 minutes. Check it after 15 minutes to see if all the water has evaporated. If it has, the rice is ready. If not, replace the lid and let the rice simmer an additional 5 minutes.</p>
            <li>Step 5</li>
            <p>Remove from the heat, fluff with a fork, and transfer into a serving dish.

                You can also stir in 1 tablespoon of butter or add chopped parsley or other herbs to the pot before serving. Enjoy.</p>
